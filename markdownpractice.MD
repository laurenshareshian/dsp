Hello, I'm practicing markdown formatting. I'll make a new line by adding two spaces to end of line.
I'll put **bold** in bold by using two asterisks on either side.
I"ll put *italic* in italic by putting one asterisk on either side.
If I want a single bar I can type dash dash dash
---
If I want a double line I can type underscore three times
___
Emojis should be between a colon on either side :watermelon:
You can also insert web links [Google](http://www.google.com/)
To print something python specifically, use 3 back quotes and the work Python:
```python
print "hello world!"
print "hello moon"
```
If you don't want it Python specific, you can leave the Python word out but still use 3 back quotes:
```
print "hello world!"
print "hello moon"
```
